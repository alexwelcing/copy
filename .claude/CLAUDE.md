# Copy & Marketing Agency

Marketing expertise encoded into executable skills for Claude Code.

## How It Works

**Skills are frameworks, not prompts.** Each skill file contains:
- Context-gathering questions
- Proven structures and formulas
- Psychological principles
- Quality checklists
- Strategic rationale

Load a skill, then use it. The skill guides the thinking.

## Using Skills

### Load and Use
```
Read skills/copywriting/SKILL.md
# Then: "Write a landing page for [product] using this framework"
```

### Skill + Input Pattern
The skill provides the methodology. You provide the specifics:
- Product details
- Target audience
- Existing content to analyze
- Brand constraints

### Compound Skills
Skills work together:
1. `marketing-psychology` → identify triggers
2. `copywriting` → write with frameworks
3. `page-cro` → audit for conversion
4. `copy-editing` → polish output

## Workflows

Pre-built sequences in `workflows/`:
- `full-service.md` - Complete campaigns
- `quick-copy.md` - Fast turnaround copy
- `cro-audit.md` - Conversion audits
- `seo-campaign.md` - SEO projects

## Agency System

For complex projects spanning multiple skills:

1. Create a rig: `agency/rigs/[project-name]/`
2. Write a brief: `brief.md` with objectives, audience, constraints
3. Track work in convoys: bundles of tasks with dependencies
4. Review outputs against brief
5. Iterate and deliver

## Key Principle

**Strategy precedes execution.** Every skill starts with understanding:
- Who is the audience?
- What's their awareness stage?
- What objections will they have?
- What proof do we have?

Copy comes last. Thinking comes first.
