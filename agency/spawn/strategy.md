## Example

> "Help me figure out positioning. We're a CRM for real estate agents. There are a hundred CRMs in this space. We're smaller than the big players but our users say we're simpler to use. Current positioning is 'The simple CRM for real estate.' Problem: 'simple' sounds like 'basic' or 'less capable.' How do we own simplicity without sounding like we're for beginners?"

Strategist will explore the space, identify a reframe, and deliver a positioning brief that solves the tension.
