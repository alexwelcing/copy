## Brief Template

Give the Director this information:

```

**Goal:**
[What action do we want them to take?]

**Key messages:**
[What must be communicated?]

**Proof points:**
[Testimonials, data, credentials we can use]

**Constraints:**
- Word count: [if any]

## Example

> "Director, here's a brief: We're launching a new feature for our invoicing software - automatic payment reminders. Target is small business owners who are tired of chasing payments. Goal is feature adoption from existing users. Key message: get paid faster without the awkward follow-up emails. We have data showing users who enable reminders get paid 40% faster. Need an in-app announcement, email to existing users, and a short explainer page."

Director takes it from there.
