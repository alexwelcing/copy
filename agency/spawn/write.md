# Quick Write

**For:** Fast turnaround copy when strategy is already clear.

Load this pattern when you know what you need and just need it written.

## Activate

```
Read agency/agents/copywriter.md
Read agency/spawn/write.md
```

Then give the Copywriter your request.

## What Happens

1. **Copywriter confirms** the ask and any missing context
2. **Copywriter drafts** using appropriate frameworks
3. **Copywriter delivers** with strategic rationale

No strategy phase, no review cycle. Fast path.

## Request Format

```
## Write Request

[What you need - headline, page section, email, ad]

**For:**
[Product/service name]

**Audience:**
[Who's reading this]

**Goal:**

**Key benefit:**

## Examples

### Landing Page Hero
> "Write a hero section for Pulse, a real-time team health monitoring tool. Audience: engineering managers. Goal: start free trial. Key benefit: spot burnout before it's too late. Tone: empathetic but not soft. Length: headline, subhead, and CTA button."

### Email Subject Lines
> "Give me 5 subject lines for a cart abandonment email. Product: online course platform. Audience: aspiring creators. Goal: complete purchase. Tone: encouraging, not pushy."

### Ad Copy
> "Write Facebook ad copy for a meditation app. Audience: stressed professionals. Goal: app download. Key benefit: fall asleep in 10 minutes. Tone: calm, credible. Length: primary text + headline + description."

## When to Use Director Instead

Use Director (not quick write) when:
- You're not sure about the positioning
- Multiple deliverables are connected
- The project needs coordination
- Strategy hasn't been figured out
