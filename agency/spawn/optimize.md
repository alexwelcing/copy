## What You Get Back

- **Improved version**: Actual rewritten/restructured content
- **Rationale**: Why the changes work
- **Test setup**: How to validate the improvement

## Example

> "Optimize this CTA. Current: 'Get Started Free' on our pricing page. It's getting 2% click-through. Target audience is marketing managers evaluating tools. The page explains our product well but the button doesn't seem to convert. Constraint: must mention 'free' since that's a key objection handler."

Optimizer returns alternatives with reasoning:
- "Start Your Free Trial" (action-oriented)
- "Try [Product] Free" (product name recognition)
- "Get Free Access Now" (urgency + clarity)

Plus test recommendations.
