## Review Types

### Strategy Check (Strategist)
"Does this align with our positioning? Are we saying the right thing?"

### Copy Review (Copywriter)
"How would you write this differently? Is the approach working?"

### Quality Review (Editor)
"Is this polished enough? What needs tightening?"

### Conversion Review (Optimizer)
"Will this convert? Where's the friction?"

### Data Check (Analyst)
"Are these claims accurate? Is this measurable?"

## Example Review Cycle

```
1. Copywriter → Editor: "Quick review on this hero section?"
2. Editor → Copywriter: "Headline's weak. Try leading with the number."
3. Copywriter revises
4. Copywriter → Editor: "Better?"
5. Editor → Copywriter: "Ship it."
```

## Review Norms

1. **Be specific.** "This doesn't work" is unhelpful. "This doesn't work because X, try Y" is useful.
2. **Be timely.** Reviews shouldn't block work for long.
3. **Be honest.** Polite lies waste everyone's time.
4. **Suggest, don't just critique.** Offer alternatives.
5. **Know your lane.** Strategist reviews strategy. Editor reviews polish. Stay in your expertise.
