# Target Audience Profiles

Three primary audiences, each with distinct entry points, pain intensity, and conversion paths.

---

## Audience 1: Technical Founders

### Who They Are
- Solo founders or small technical teams (1-5 engineers)
- Building B2B SaaS, dev tools, or technical products
- Revenue: Pre-seed to $1M ARR
- Already using Claude Code or similar AI tools
- Marketing budget: $0-5k/month (DIY)

### Psychographics
- **Identity**: Builder, maker, craftsperson
- **Values**: Efficiency, quality, autonomy
- **Fears**: Wasting time on non-core work, looking amateur
- **Frustrations**: Marketing feels like a foreign language
- **Aspirations**: Ship a product people actually use

### Pain Points (in order of intensity)
1. **"I know my product is good but I can't explain it"** - The curse of knowledge. Deep technical understanding makes it hard to write for non-experts.

2. **"I've rewritten my landing page 20 times"** - Endless iteration without a framework. No way to know if it's "good."

3. **"ChatGPT copy sounds like ChatGPT"** - Generic, hollow output that embarrasses them.

4. **"I don't have time for this"** - Marketing is a distraction from building.

5. **"Agencies want $15k to write a landing page"** - Priced out of professional help.

### Trigger Events
- About to launch (need landing page)
- Conversion rate tanking (need optimization)
- Raising funds (need pitch materials)
- First real competitor appeared (need positioning)

### Objections
| Objection | Reality | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| "I can prompt Claude myself" | True, but they don't know marketing | "You can. But do you know when to use loss aversion vs. social proof?" |
| "This is just prompt engineering" | It's framework engineering | "Open the skill file. It's 2000 words of methodology, not a template." |
| "I don't have time to learn another tool" | It's 30 seconds | "Load one file. Ask it to write. That's it." |
| "Will this sound like AI slop?" | Their current approach does | "Only if you give it generic inputs. Specificity in, specificity out." |

### What They Actually Need
- **Immediate**: Landing page that explains their product
- **Underlying**: A way to think about marketing without becoming a marketer
- **Deeper**: Permission to ship imperfect marketing and iterate

### Conversion Path
```
Entry: GitHub readme / HN post / Dev Twitter
       ↓
Interest: "23 skills that encode marketing frameworks"
       ↓
Activation: Use copywriting skill on their own landing page
       ↓
Aha moment: Output is better than their 20 drafts
       ↓
Expansion: Try CRO skill on the new copy
       ↓
Retention: Return for email sequences, launch strategy
```

### Messaging That Works
- "Stop prompting. Start deploying."
- "Marketing expertise that runs in your terminal."
- "The frameworks agencies use, without the agency."
- "Your landing page, written in 5 minutes, not 5 days."

### Messaging That Fails
- "AI-powered marketing platform" (generic)
- "10x your content production" (empty multiplier)
- "Revolutionary marketing automation" (buzzword salad)

---

## Audience 2: Startup Marketing Teams

### Who They Are
- Marketing team of 1-3 at a startup
- Series A to Series B ($2M-20M raised)
- Reporting to CEO/CMO who wants more output
- Generalists wearing many hats
- Budget: $10-50k/month but stretched thin

### Psychographics
- **Identity**: Strategic thinker, scrappy executor
- **Values**: Impact, learning, recognition
- **Fears**: Being replaced by AI, falling behind
- **Frustrations**: Too many tasks, not enough time
- **Aspirations**: Build a marketing engine that scales

### Pain Points (in order of intensity)
1. **"I need to produce 10x more content with the same team"** - CEO saw a TikTok about AI and now expects miracles.

2. **"Every AI tool produces the same garbage"** - They've tried Jasper, Copy.ai, etc. Same hollow output.

3. **"I'm spending 3 hours on first drafts"** - Writing from scratch every time.

4. **"I know what good looks like but can't get there fast enough"** - Taste exceeds bandwidth.

5. **"The junior writers need constant editing"** - Quality control bottleneck.

### Trigger Events
- New product launch requiring 50+ assets
- Demand gen targets doubled
- Team member quit (now underwater)
- CEO questioning content quality

### Objections
| Objection | Reality | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| "We already have a content workflow" | This enhances, not replaces | "Use it for first drafts. Keep your editing process." |
| "AI can't match our brand voice" | It can with proper inputs | "The skill asks about brand voice before writing." |
| "I don't want to learn command line" | Claude Code is approachable | "If you can use Slack, you can use this." |
| "My boss will think I'm being lazy" | Output quality is the proof | "The quality speaks for itself. They won't know the difference." |

### What They Actually Need
- **Immediate**: First drafts that don't suck
- **Underlying**: A framework for thinking about content strategy
- **Deeper**: A way to scale without hiring

### Conversion Path
```
Entry: Twitter marketing thread / Newsletter mention
       ↓
Interest: "23 frameworks for different marketing tasks"
       ↓
Activation: Use email-sequence skill for upcoming campaign
       ↓
Aha moment: Sequence outline is better than their brief
       ↓
Expansion: Try marketing-psychology on landing page
       ↓
Retention: Becomes standard first-draft tool
```

### Messaging That Works
- "First drafts that don't need a rewrite."
- "The frameworks you learned from books, made executable."
- "Scale content without scaling headcount."
- "Your marketing swipe file, made executable."

### Messaging That Fails
- "Replace your content team with AI" (threatening)
- "Automate your marketing" (not what this is)
- "Content at scale" (every AI tool says this)

## Audience 3: Freelance Marketers

### Who They Are
- Solo marketing consultants or small agencies (1-5 people)
- Serve 3-10 clients simultaneously
- Revenue: $100k-500k/year
- Time is their only real constraint
- Already charging $100-300/hour

### Psychographics
- **Identity**: Expert, craftsperson, trusted advisor
- **Values**: Quality, reputation, independence
- **Fears**: Commoditization, scope creep, burnout
- **Frustrations**: Clients want champagne on a beer budget
- **Aspirations**: Work less, earn more, maintain quality

### Pain Points (in order of intensity)
1. **"I'm selling hours but running out of them"** - Can't scale without hiring or raising rates.

2. **"Clients expect instant turnaround"** - The AI era has shortened expectations.

3. **"I keep reinventing the same deliverables"** - No systemization of their expertise.

4. **"Junior freelancers are undercutting my rates"** - Race to the bottom.

5. **"AI tools don't think strategically"** - They've tried automation, it doesn't work.

### Trigger Events
- Took on one too many clients
- Key client asked for "AI-assisted" rates
- Realized they're selling time, not value
- Saw a competitor productizing

### Objections
| Objection | Reality | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| "My clients pay for my expertise, not AI" | The expertise is in the framework selection | "You still choose the approach. This executes it." |
| "What if clients find out I use AI?" | They probably already assume it | "The quality is the answer. If it's good, who cares how?" |
| "This could replace me" | It makes you more valuable | "It lets you take on more clients, not fewer." |
| "I have my own processes" | These enhance yours | "Use these as inputs to your process. Or just steal the frameworks." |

### What They Actually Need
- **Immediate**: Force multiplier for execution
- **Underlying**: Systematization of their expertise
- **Deeper**: A way to productize without losing the craft

### Conversion Path
```
Entry: Marketing community / Freelancer Twitter
       ↓
Interest: "The frameworks I use, made executable"
       ↓
Activation: Use on a current client deliverable
       ↓
Aha moment: Cut drafting time by 70%
       ↓
Expansion: Build workflow for common deliverables
       ↓
Retention: Standard tool in their stack
```

### Messaging That Works
- "Your brain, systematized."
- "Deliver more without working more."
- "The frameworks you already use, made executable."
- "Take on three more clients without hiring."

### Messaging That Fails
- "Become a 10x marketer" (insulting to experts)
- "No marketing expertise needed" (they have expertise)
- "Cheap and fast content" (they sell quality)

## Audience Prioritization

| Audience | TAM | Pain Intensity | Accessibility | Priority |
|----------|-----|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Technical Founders | Large | Very High | High (Claude Code users) | **#1** |
| Freelance Marketers | Medium | High | Medium | **#2** |
| Startup Marketing | Large | Medium | Low (enterprise-ish) | **#3** |

**Rationale**:
1. Technical founders are already in Claude Code, pain is acute, and they'll evangelize
2. Freelancers have immediate ROI and will spread word-of-mouth
3. Startup marketing teams have more buying friction and longer cycles
