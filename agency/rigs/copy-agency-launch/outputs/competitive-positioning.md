# Competitive Positioning: Copy & Marketing Agency

*Generated using the `competitor-alternatives` skill*

---

## Market Landscape

The user seeking AI-powered marketing help has four main paths:

1. **Raw LLM prompting** (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. **AI writing tools** (Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic)
3. **Human agencies/freelancers**
4. **DIY with templates/guides**

We occupy a new category: **Executable marketing expertise** that runs inside a developer's existing workflow (Claude Code).

## Competitive Analysis

### vs. Raw LLM Prompting (ChatGPT/Claude)

**Their approach**:
- User writes a prompt
- AI generates response
- User iterates through conversation
- No framework, no methodology
- Same output everyone gets

**Our approach**:
- Load a specialized skill
- Skill guides context gathering
- Frameworks applied systematically
- Quality checklist validation
- Reproducible, improvable process

**Our positioning**:
> "Stop prompting. Start deploying."

**Key differentiators**:
| Aspect | Raw Prompting | Our Skills |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Context gathering | None | Systematic |
| Framework | Whatever AI knows | Explicit, proven |
| Quality assurance | Manual review | Built-in checklists |
| Consistency | Variable | Reproducible |
| Learning | Lost in chat | Documented, editable |

**Messaging**:
- "A prompt is a one-shot request. A skill is a complete mental model."
- "The skill knows what questions to ask before writing anything."

---

### vs. AI Writing Tools (Jasper, Copy.ai)

**Their approach**:
- Template-based generation
- Fill in blanks → get output
- Web interface, subscription model
- Designed for non-technical marketers
- Black box methodology

**Our approach**:
- Framework-based thinking
- Understand before writing
- Lives in developer workflow
- Open source, free, editable
- Transparent methodology

**Our positioning**:
> "Frameworks, not fill-in-the-blanks."

**Key differentiators**:
| Aspect | AI Writing Tools | Our Skills |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Input method | Templates | Strategic frameworks |
| Workflow | Web app | Claude Code (CLI) |
| Customization | Limited | Fully editable |
| Cost | $49-150/mo | Free |
| Transparency | Black box | Open methodology |
| Target user | Marketers | Developers/founders |

**Messaging**:
- "Jasper gives you templates. We give you the thinking."
- "See exactly why every recommendation is made."

### vs. Human Agencies/Freelancers

**Their approach**:
- Expensive ($5k-50k+ per project)
- Slow (weeks to months)
- High quality (when good)
- Limited scalability
- Expertise locked in people

**Our approach**:
- Free
- Instant
- Quality dependent on inputs
- Unlimited scalability
- Expertise encoded in files

**Our positioning**:
> "Agency thinking at dev speed."

**We don't replace agencies entirely**. We handle:
- First drafts
- Quick iterations
- Low-stakes content
- Learning the frameworks

Agencies still win for:
- High-stakes campaigns
- Brand development
- Strategy that requires research
- Execution at scale

**Messaging**:
- "Get the frameworks agencies use, without the agency."
- "Good enough to ship, or a head start for refinement."

---

### vs. DIY Templates/Guides

**Their approach**:
- Read a guide/book
- Apply manually
- High effort
- Knowledge transfer varies
- Hard to maintain consistency

**Our approach**:
- Framework is executable
- Guides the process
- Lower effort
- Consistent application
- Continuously improvable

**Our positioning**:
> "Executable expertise."

**Messaging**:
- "Instead of reading about copywriting frameworks, use them."
- "The swipe file that writes with you."

## Positioning Matrix

```
                    High Strategic Depth
                           ↑
                           |
    Human Agencies    ←←←  |  →→→  Our Skills
                           |
Low                        |           High
Accessibility              |     Accessibility

                           ↓
                    Low Strategic Depth
```

**Our quadrant**: High strategic depth + High accessibility

This is the opportunity. No one else occupies this space for the developer/founder audience.

## Unique Value Proposition

### For Developers/Technical Founders

> "Marketing expertise that runs in your terminal. 23 skills that encode the frameworks top marketers use—context gathering, proven structures, quality checks. Load a skill, get structured thinking, ship better marketing."

### For Marketers Who Code

> "Your marketing swipe file, made executable. Stop re-reading the same copywriting books. Load the framework directly into Claude Code and apply it."

### For Indie Hackers

> "Full-service agency thinking, zero agency cost. Write landing pages, optimize conversions, plan launches—all with frameworks that actually work."

---

## Objection Handling

### "It's just prompts"

**Response**: "Open the skill file. It's not a prompt template—it's a complete framework with context questions, psychological principles, structural formulas, and quality checklists. The skill guides the thinking, not just the output."

### "AI copy is generic"

**Response**: "Generic copy comes from generic prompts. Our skills start with specific context: Who's the audience? What's their awareness stage? What objections exist? Specificity in → specificity out."

### "I can do this myself with a good prompt"

**Response**: "You can. But will you remember to ask about awareness stage? Will you apply loss aversion appropriately? Will you check against 15 quality criteria? The skill encodes everything so you don't have to hold it in your head."

### "Why not just hire a copywriter?"

**Response**: "For high-stakes work, you should. This is for the 80% of marketing work that needs to be good enough, fast. First drafts, iterations, experiments. Ship today, hire for the rebrand."

## Messaging Themes

### Primary: Skills vs. Prompts
- "Stop prompting. Start deploying."
- "A prompt is a request. A skill is a methodology."
- "23 marketing skills. Each one a complete framework."

### Secondary: Proof by Demonstration
- "We dogfooded this on itself. The README is the proof."
- "The quality of the output is the evidence."
- "Built with the copywriting skill. Optimized with page-cro."

### Tertiary: Developer-First
- "Marketing that runs in your terminal."
- "Agency thinking at dev speed."
- "Open source. Editable. Free."

---

## Competitive Moat

### What protects this position:

1. **Deep framework quality**: Skills encode real expertise, not surface patterns
2. **Dogfooding proof**: We use it on ourselves, improving continuously
3. **Open source community**: Contributors improve and extend
4. **Claude Code integration**: Native to the platform where users already work
5. **Documentation quality**: The skills themselves teach marketing

### What doesn't protect us:

- Proprietary technology (it's open source)
- Network effects (limited)
- Switching costs (low)

**Strategy**: Win on quality, depth, and community. Be the best, not the only.
