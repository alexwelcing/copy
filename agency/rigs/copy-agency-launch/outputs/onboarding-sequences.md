# Audience-Specific Onboarding Sequences

Three tailored email sequences based on entry point and audience type.

---

## Sequence A: Technical Founders

**Entry trigger**: Signs up after viewing `/for/founders` or uses `copywriting` skill first
**Goal**: Get them to ship a landing page, then expand to CRO and launch strategy

### Email 1: Quick Win (Sent immediately)
**Subject**: Your landing page is 5 minutes away

```
You signed up because you're tired of rewriting that landing page.

Let's fix that right now.

Here's what to do:

1. Open Claude Code
2. Load the copywriting skill: `Read skills/copywriting/SKILL.md`
3. Tell it: "Write a landing page for [your product]. Target audience: [who]. Key benefit: [what]."

That's it. You'll have a draft better than your last 20 attempts.

The skill will ask clarifying questions. Answer them. The more specific you are, the better the output.

Go. Ship something today.

– High Era

P.S. The output not perfect? Good. It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be a solid first draft that you can refine. Perfection is the enemy of shipping.
```

### Email 2: Framework Mental Model (Day 2)
**Subject**: Why this isn't just "another AI writing tool"

```
Yesterday you got a draft.

Today, let's talk about why it worked (or how to make it work better).

Most AI copy is garbage because most prompts are garbage. "Write me a landing page" is a garbage prompt.

The copywriting skill does something different. Before it writes a single word, it establishes:

- Who's the audience?
- What's their current awareness level?
- What objections will they have?
- What proof exists to counter those objections?

Then it applies frameworks: PAS, AIDA, Before-After-Bridge. Not randomly—strategically, based on the context.

This is how professional copywriters work. They think first, write second.

The skill encodes that thinking. You provide the specifics. It provides the structure.

Want to go deeper? Open the skill file and read it. It's 2000 words of methodology. Steal the frameworks. Understand why it works.

Tomorrow: How to audit your new copy for conversion.

– High Era
```

### Email 3: Skill Stacking (Day 4)
**Subject**: Your landing page is live. Now optimize it.

```
Assuming you shipped that landing page (you did ship, right?)—now it's time to make it convert.

Load the page-cro skill:
`Read skills/page-cro/SKILL.md`

Paste your landing page copy. Tell it to audit for conversion.

You'll get:
- Above-the-fold assessment
- Friction analysis
- CTA evaluation
- Mobile considerations
- Specific recommendations, prioritized by impact

Here's the pattern: Copywriting → CRO → Implementation → Repeat.

Each skill builds on the last. The copywriting skill gives you words. The CRO skill tells you if those words convert. Then you iterate.

This is compound expertise. The more skills you use together, the better the output.

Tomorrow: 23 skills, but which ones do you actually need?

– High Era
```

### Email 4: Skill Map (Day 6)
**Subject**: The 5 skills that matter for you

```
There are 23 skills. You don't need all of them.

For a technical founder shipping a product, here's your stack:

1. **copywriting** – Landing page, product descriptions, any customer-facing words
2. **page-cro** – Audit those words for conversion
3. **launch-strategy** – Plan the Product Hunt / HN / community launch
4. **competitor-alternatives** – Position against the alternatives
5. **email-sequence** – Welcome series for signups

That's it. Five skills. Covers 90% of what you need pre-launch.

Ignore the rest until you need them. SEO, paid ads, referral programs—those are post-traction problems.

Ship first. Optimize later.

Here's your priority order:
1. Landing page (copywriting + page-cro)
2. Positioning (competitor-alternatives)
3. Launch plan (launch-strategy)
4. Email capture (email-sequence)

Go.

– High Era
```

### Email 5: Community (Day 10)
**Subject**: You're not alone in this

```
Building a product is lonely work.

Marketing that product is lonelier.

You're probably doing this between commits, after hours, when you should be sleeping.

A few things that might help:

1. **The skills are open source.** Fork them. Improve them. Adapt them to your specific product.

2. **The methodology is documented.** Every skill file explains why it works. Read them when you're stuck.

3. **Feedback makes it better.** If a skill doesn't work for your use case, that's a bug. Tell us.

This isn't a tool you rent. It's infrastructure you own.

Use it. Ship something. Let us know how it goes.

– High Era

P.S. If you've shipped something using the skills, reply to this email. We'd love to see it.

## Sequence B: Freelance Marketers

**Entry trigger**: Signs up after viewing `/for/freelancers` or uses `email-sequence` or `page-cro` first
**Goal**: Help them see immediate ROI on client work, then systematize

### Email 1: ROI Frame (Sent immediately)
**Subject**: That client deliverable, done in 30 minutes

```
You charge $200/hour. You signed up because you want to deliver more in fewer hours.

Let's make that real right now.

Pick a current client project—an email sequence, landing page, whatever you're working on.

Load the relevant skill. For email sequences:
`Read skills/email-sequence/SKILL.md`

Input the brief. Get a complete sequence in minutes instead of hours.

You'll still edit. You'll still apply judgment. But the structure is done. The frameworks are applied. You just saved 2-3 hours on a deliverable.

That's $400-600 of margin you just created. On one deliverable.

Multiply that across your client roster.

Go use it on something real. Right now.

– High Era
```

### Email 2: The Real Skill (Day 2)
**Subject**: They're paying for judgment, not typing

```
Here's the thing about using AI for client work:

Your clients aren't paying for typing. They're paying for taste.

The skill gives you frameworks. AIDA. PAS. Before-After-Bridge. The structures that work.

You add the insight. The nuance. The "this doesn't quite fit their voice" edits.

That's the split:
- AI: Structure, speed, consistency
- You: Judgment, refinement, strategy

When a client asks how you work, the answer is simple: "I use proven frameworks and customize heavily for your specific situation."

That's true. That's always been true. Now you're just faster at the framework part.

Tomorrow: Building a repeatable system.

– High Era
```

### Email 3: Systemization (Day 4)
**Subject**: Your best deliverables, productized

```
You've done 50 email sequences. Each one started from scratch.

What if you didn't?

The skills are markdown files. They're editable.

Here's the play:

1. Take a skill (like email-sequence)
2. Add your own frameworks
3. Add your brand voice guidelines template
4. Add your common client types
5. Save it as your-email-sequence.md

Now you have a productized deliverable. Same quality every time. Less time every time.

This is how you escape the hours trap. You're not selling time anymore. You're selling a system that happens to require some of your time.

Tomorrow: Skills you might be missing.

– High Era
```

### Email 4: Skill Expansion (Day 6)
**Subject**: Beyond copy: The strategy skills

```
You've used the writing skills. But there's more.

The strategy skills change the conversation with clients:

**competitor-alternatives**
Run it on a new client. Show up to the kickoff with a positioning map they've never seen. Instant credibility.

**marketing-psychology**
Cialdini's principles, applied to their specific situation. "Here's why we should use scarcity on the pricing page."

**pricing-strategy**
"I audited your pricing structure. Here's what I found." New revenue stream.

Each of these turns you from "writer" to "strategist." Same work, higher rates.

– High Era
```

### Email 5: The Network (Day 10)
**Subject**: Freelancers helping freelancers

```
The best freelancers share frameworks.

These skills are open source. Fork them. Improve them. Share your variations.

A few ideas:

- Add your brand voice template to the copywriting skill
- Create a client onboarding checklist skill
- Build a proposal generator based on your winning proposals

The system is designed to be extended.

If you build something good, we'd love to include it. Reply with your variation.

– High Era

## Sequence C: Marketing Teams

**Entry trigger**: Signs up after viewing `/for/marketing-teams` or multiple users from same domain
**Goal**: Team adoption, workflow integration

### Email 1: Team Proof of Concept (Sent immediately)
**Subject**: Show your team in 15 minutes

```
You need to prove this works before you can roll it out.

Here's your proof-of-concept:

1. Open Claude Code
2. Load marketing-ideas: `Read skills/marketing-ideas/SKILL.md`
3. Input your current campaign brief
4. Get 20 prioritized tactics with effort/impact scoring

Show the output to your team. Ask: "What would it take us to brainstorm this normally?"

Answer: Half a day in a room.

Time spent: 15 minutes.

That's the pitch. AI as force multiplier, not replacement.

Now: Which skill solves your biggest bottleneck?

– High Era
```

### Email 2: Workflow Integration (Day 2)
**Subject**: Where this fits in your process

```
You have a content workflow. You're not replacing it.

Here's where the skills slot in:

**Before the brief**: marketing-ideas, competitor-alternatives
**First draft**: copywriting, email-sequence, social-content
**Quality check**: page-cro, copy-editing
**Launch**: launch-strategy, ab-test-setup

The skills accelerate specific stages. Your approval process, brand guidelines, and quality bar stay exactly the same.

Input is faster. Standards are unchanged.

Tomorrow: How to maintain brand consistency.

– High Era
```

### Email 3: Brand Voice (Day 4)
**Subject**: "But it won't match our brand"

```
That's a real concern. Here's how to solve it.

Every skill asks about voice and tone before writing. But you can go further.

Create a brand context file:

```markdown
# Brand Voice Guide

## Tone
Confident but not arrogant. Technical but accessible.

## We say
- "Here's how it works" (direct)
- "Built for teams like yours" (specific)

## We never say
- "Revolutionary" (hyperbolic)
- "Synergy" (corporate)

## Examples
[Include 3-4 examples of great copy]
```

Load this alongside any skill:
`Read brand-voice.md` then `Read skills/copywriting/SKILL.md`

Now every output follows your guidelines.

– High Era
```

### Email 4: Team Rollout (Day 6)
**Subject**: Getting the team on board

```
You've tested it. It works. Now to scale.

Here's a rollout that works:

**Week 1**: You + one power user
- Pick your fastest writer
- Have them test on real work
- Document what works

**Week 2**: Writing team pilot
- Share the 3 most useful skills
- Set expectation: "Use for first drafts"
- Keep your editing process

**Week 3**: Full team access
- Shared brand context file
- Documented workflows
- Clear guidelines: when to use, when not to

The key: Position as "faster first drafts," not "replace writers." Adoption follows.

– High Era
```

### Email 5: Measurement (Day 10)
**Subject**: Is it actually working?

```
Your CEO will ask for numbers. Here's what to track:

**Time metrics**
- First draft time (before vs. after)
- Editing time (should decrease)
- Total time to publish

**Quality metrics**
- Editing passes required
- Reverts to pre-AI process
- Team satisfaction

**Output metrics**
- Content pieces per week
- Campaign turnaround time

Set baselines now. Measure for 4 weeks. Report.

The story you want: "Same quality, 40% less time" or "40% more output, same resources."

Both are wins. Track to prove it.

– High Era

## Sequence Routing Logic

```python
def assign_sequence(user):
    # Check entry page
    if user.entry_page == '/for/founders':
        return 'sequence_a_founders'
    elif user.entry_page == '/for/freelancers':
        return 'sequence_b_freelancers'
    elif user.entry_page == '/for/marketing-teams':
        return 'sequence_c_teams'

    # Check first skill used
    if user.first_skill in ['copywriting', 'launch-strategy', 'competitor-alternatives']:
        return 'sequence_a_founders'
    elif user.first_skill in ['email-sequence', 'page-cro', 'marketing-psychology']:
        return 'sequence_b_freelancers'
    elif user.first_skill in ['marketing-ideas', 'social-content']:
        return 'sequence_c_teams'

    # Check domain patterns
    if multiple_users_from_domain(user.email):
        return 'sequence_c_teams'

    # Default to founders (largest audience)
    return 'sequence_a_founders'
```
