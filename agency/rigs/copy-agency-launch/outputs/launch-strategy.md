# Launch Strategy: Copy & Marketing Agency

*Generated using the `launch-strategy` skill*

---

## Launch Type: Soft Launch → Community Launch

**Rationale**: This is a developer tool for Claude Code users. The audience is already in technical communities. A Product Hunt-style launch would miss the mark—instead, we launch where the audience already lives.

**Primary channels**:
1. GitHub (the product itself)
2. Claude Code community / Discord
3. Twitter/X (dev/founder audience)
4. Hacker News (Show HN)

---

## Pre-Launch Phase (Before Sharing)

### Build the Proof

The product must demonstrate itself before launch. This is done.

**Completed**:
- [x] README rewritten using copywriting skill (proof of quality)
- [x] Copywriting skill enhanced with psychology frameworks
- [x] Brief created for self-marketing campaign
- [x] Campaign rig established with brand guidelines

**The meta-narrative**: "We built a marketing skill system and used it to market itself. The README you're reading is the proof."

### Prepare Assets

**Required for launch**:
- [x] Sharp README that converts (done)
- [x] Clear "how to use" instructions (done)
- [ ] 2-minute demo video/GIF showing skill in action
- [ ] Before/after example (generic prompt vs. skill output)
- [ ] Social proof: early user testimonials

### Prime the Community

**1 week before**:
- Share "building in public" posts about the project
- Engage in Claude Code discussions
- Help people with marketing questions (demonstrate expertise)
- Tease the project without hard selling

## Launch Day Execution

### GitHub Launch

**Timing**: Weekday, morning PST

**Actions**:
1. Ensure README is polished
2. Add relevant topics/tags
3. Create first release with changelog
4. Star from personal accounts (legitimate engagement)

### Twitter/X Thread

**Format**: Thread showing the before/after transformation

```
Tweet 1:
I got tired of asking Claude to "write some copy" and getting generic garbage.

So I built something different: 23 marketing skills that encode actual frameworks—the same mental models top copywriters use.

Here's the difference [screenshot before/after]

Tweet 2:
The problem with prompting for copy:
- No context gathering
- No framework
- No quality checks
- Same output everyone else gets

A skill is different. It's a complete mental model, not a template.

Tweet 3:
Example: the copywriting skill doesn't just write headlines.

It first asks: What's the awareness stage? What objections exist? What proof do we have?

THEN it applies proven formulas. THEN it validates against a quality checklist.

Tweet 4:
We dogfooded the entire system on itself.

The README was written using the copywriting skill.
The page structure follows page-cro principles.
The copy was refined using copy-editing frameworks.

The quality of the output IS the proof that it works.

Tweet 5:
23 skills total:

Writing: copywriting, copy-editing, email-sequence, social-content
CRO: page-cro, form-cro, signup-flow-cro, onboarding-cro
SEO: seo-audit, programmatic-seo, schema-markup
Strategy: launch-strategy, pricing, referral-program, competitor positioning

And more.

Tweet 6:
It's free, it's open source, and it works with Claude Code.

If you're building something and need marketing assets, try loading a skill instead of prompting raw.

Let me know what you build.

- "Show HN: Marketing expertise encoded as executable skills for Claude Code"

Hi HN,

I built a system of marketing skills for Claude Code. Instead of asking Claude to "write copy," you load a skill that contains a complete framework—context questions, proven structures, quality checklists.

The difference: a prompt is a one-shot request. A skill knows what questions to ask before writing anything.

Example: The copywriting skill doesn't just write headlines. It first identifies awareness stage, objections, and proof points. Then it applies tested formulas. Then it validates against quality checks.

23 skills covering: copywriting, CRO, SEO, email sequences, launch strategy, pricing, and more.

We dogfooded it—the README was written using our copywriting skill. The quality of the output is the proof.

Free, open source, works with Claude Code: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the approach or specific skills.
```

### Direct Outreach

**Target list**:
- Founders who've tweeted about AI + marketing
- Claude Code power users
- Indie hackers building products
- Marketing-adjacent developers

**Outreach template**:
```
Hey [name],

Saw your tweet about [relevant topic].

I just shipped something you might find useful: 23 marketing skills for Claude Code. Instead of prompting raw, you load a skill with a complete framework—the same mental models top copywriters use.

Thought you might want to try it on [their product/project].

No ask, just thought it'd be relevant to what you're building.

## Post-Launch (Week 1)

### Engagement

- Respond to every GitHub issue/question
- Engage with every tweet/HN comment
- Collect feedback systematically
- Ship quick improvements based on feedback

### Content Follow-Up

**Day 2**: Share a specific use case (e.g., "Used the email-sequence skill to write an onboarding flow")

**Day 3-4**: Write a deeper piece on the philosophy (skills vs prompts)

**Day 5-7**: Share user success stories / implementations

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| GitHub stars | 100+ week 1 |
| Forks | 20+ |
| Twitter impressions | 50k+ |
| HN points | 50+ (if posted) |
| Direct outreach replies | 20%+ |

---

## Long-Term Momentum

### Content Strategy

- Document skill improvements publicly
- Write about the theory behind specific skills
- Share before/after transformations
- Build a gallery of outputs

### Community Building

- Create a channel for users to share outputs
- Feature best implementations
- Collect and incorporate feedback
- Build a contributor community for new skills

### Expansion Paths

1. **More skills**: Response to user requests
2. **Skill variations**: Industry-specific versions
3. **Integration**: Deeper Claude Code hooks
4. **Templates**: Pre-built project types

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: "It's just prompts"
**Mitigation**: Emphasize the framework nature—context gathering, structures, checklists. Show the skill file itself.

**Risk**: "AI copy is generic"
**Mitigation**: Before/after comparisons. The README as proof. User testimonials.

**Risk**: "Too complex to use"
**Mitigation**: Clear quick-start. Single skill can be used immediately. Complexity is opt-in.
