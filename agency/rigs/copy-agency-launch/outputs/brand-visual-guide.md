# Brand Visual Guide: The High Era (Remotion Vision)
# Version 2.0.0 (The Realism Pivot)

This guide defines the visual identity for the "High Era" expansion. It rejects the digital-neon cliche in favor of cinematic realism, human craft, and the sophisticated atmosphere of 1960s Madison Avenue.

## 1. Core Concept: "The Human Signature"
The brand identity is built on **Sophisticated Precision**—the intersection of AI speed and the deliberate, tactile craft of legendary advertising.

## 2. Color Palette

### Primary: Midnight Navy
- **HEX**: `#0F172A`
- **Purpose**: Deep, authoritative backgrounds and primary text.
- **Vibe**: Executive, timeless, heavy.

### Secondary: Antique Cream
- **HEX**: `#FDFCF0`
- **Purpose**: Main surface color, paper textures, background for text.
- **Vibe**: Tactile, expensive, classic.

### Accent: Burnished Brass
- **HEX**: `#B45309`
- **Purpose**: Subtle highlights, call-to-action details, active states.
- **Vibe**: Warm, metallic, historical.

### Neutral: Smoke & Ink
- **HEX**: `#475569` (Subtitles)
- **HEX**: `#1E293B` (Contrast panels)

## 3. Typography
- **Headline Font**: `Playfair Display` or `Cormorant Garamond` (Serif) - Elegant, high-contrast, authoritative.
- **Body Font**: `Inter` (Sans-serif) - Clean, modern readability but set with generous leading.
- **Monospace Font**: `Courier Prime` - Used for dynamic variables, reminiscent of a high-end typewriter.

## 4. Visual Elements

### The Cinematic Grain
All video and image assets must have a subtle film grain. No "perfect" digital gradients.

### Rich Textures
Use textures of heavy-weight paper, mahogany, and brushed metal in the UI.

### Deliberate Layouts
Generous white space (or cream space). Symmetry. High-contrast photography.

## 5. Tone of Voice
- **Authoritative**: We don't "try" to be fast; we are precise.
- **Human-Centric**: Focus on the *result* of the work, not the chips that powered it.
- **Understated**: True power doesn't need to scream in neon.

## 6. Model Protocols (The "Realism" Filter)
- **Image (Flux 2 Pro)**: Guidance must include "Kodak Portra 400, 35mm film, cinematic lighting, realistic textures, highly detailed, mid-century office aesthetic."
- **Video (LTX2)**: Guidance must include "Cinematic pan, 24fps, film grain, realistic motion, professional color grade, soft shadows."
