# Onboarding Email Sequence: Copy & Marketing Agency

*Generated using the `email-sequence` skill*

---

## Sequence Overview

**Goal**: Get new users from "cloned the repo" to "shipped something using a skill"

**Activation event**: User successfully uses a skill to generate output

**Sequence length**: 5 emails over 7 days

**Tone**: Direct, helpful, not salesy (it's free anyway)

---

## Email 1: Welcome + Quick Win

**Send**: Immediately after signup/star

**Subject line options**:
- "Your first skill: try this"
- "Start here → one command"
- "You're in. Here's how to start."

**Body**:

```
Subject: Start here → one command

You've got 23 marketing skills ready to use.

Here's the fastest way to see what they actually do:

1. Open Claude Code in the repo
2. Type: Read skills/copywriting/SKILL.md
3. Then: "Write a headline for [your product] using this framework"

That's it. The skill guides the thinking—you'll see the difference immediately.

Compare it to just asking Claude to "write a headline." The skill version will ask about awareness stage, objections, and proof points before writing anything.

That's the difference between prompting and deploying.

Reply if you hit any friction. I read every response.

P.S. The copywriting skill is a good start, but page-cro is my personal favorite. Try auditing your own landing page.
```

**Goal**: First skill usage within 24 hours

## Email 2: The Framework Mental Model

**Send**: Day 2

**Subject line options**:
- "Why skills beat prompts (in 60 seconds)"
- "The real difference"
- "What you're actually getting"

**Body**:

```
Subject: Why skills beat prompts (in 60 seconds)

Quick concept that makes everything click:

A prompt is a one-shot request.
"Write me a landing page headline."

A skill is a mental model.
It asks: Who's the audience? What's their awareness stage? What objections will they have? What proof do we have?

THEN it applies formulas. THEN it validates.

The skill knows what questions to ask before writing anything.

That's why the output is different. Better inputs → better outputs.

Here's something to try today:

1. Read skills/page-cro/SKILL.md
2. Paste your landing page
3. Ask for an audit

You'll get structured recommendations with strategic rationale—not just "make the button bigger."

See you tomorrow.

**Goal**: Reinforce the value prop, introduce CRO skill

## Email 3: The Hidden Gem

**Send**: Day 4

**Subject line options**:
- "The skill nobody uses (but should)"
- "Try this one next"
- "Most underrated skill in the system"

**Body**:

```
Subject: The skill nobody uses (but should)

Everyone starts with copywriting. Makes sense.

But the skill that's made the biggest difference for users?

marketing-psychology.

It's not about writing—it's about thinking. Cialdini's principles. Cognitive biases. Emotional triggers.

Load it before any writing task:

Read skills/marketing-psychology/SKILL.md

Then ask: "What psychological principles should I apply to [my landing page / email / ad]?"

It'll give you specific techniques:
- Social proof placement
- Loss aversion framing
- Scarcity (if authentic)
- Authority borrowing

Apply those insights, THEN use the copywriting skill.

The combo is powerful.

P.S. If you're launching something, also check out launch-strategy. It's a complete playbook.

**Goal**: Introduce skill combinations, deepen engagement

## Email 4: The Full Workflow

**Send**: Day 6

**Subject line options**:
- "How to run a full campaign"
- "Beyond single skills"
- "The compound effect"

**Body**:

```
Subject: How to run a full campaign

You've used individual skills. Now here's how they compound.

For a landing page project:

1. **marketing-psychology** → identify triggers to apply
2. **copywriting** → write the page with frameworks
3. **page-cro** → audit your draft for conversion issues
4. **copy-editing** → polish the final version

Each skill feeds the next. The output quality multiplies.

For a launch:

1. **launch-strategy** → plan the rollout
2. **copywriting** → write announcement content
3. **email-sequence** → design the launch emails
4. **social-content** → create platform-specific posts

The workflows/ folder has pre-built sequences:
- workflows/full-service.md
- workflows/quick-copy.md
- workflows/cro-audit.md
- workflows/seo-campaign.md

Pick one that matches your project.

P.S. We're building more workflows based on what users need. Reply with what you're working on—might inspire the next one.
```

**Goal**: Introduce workflows, encourage multi-skill usage

## Email 5: Make It Yours

**Send**: Day 7

**Subject line options**:
- "One last thing"
- "The skills are yours to edit"
- "Make it yours"

**Body**:

```
Subject: The skills are yours to edit

Here's something most people miss:

The skills are just markdown files. You can edit them.

If your industry has specific needs, add them.
If you have a voice guide, include it.
If certain frameworks work better for your audience, emphasize them.

The system gets better as you customize it.

Some ideas:
- Add your brand voice to the copywriting skill
- Include your customer research in audience sections
- Create industry-specific variations

Fork it. Extend it. Make it yours.

And if you build something good, consider contributing it back. The more skills, the more everyone benefits.

That's it for onboarding. You've got the tools.

Go ship something.

## Subject Line Testing Notes

For each email, test:
- Direct/instructive vs. curiosity-based
- Short vs. medium length
- With emoji vs. without (audience-dependent)

Current hypothesis: This audience prefers direct, no-nonsense subject lines. Avoid clickbait.
