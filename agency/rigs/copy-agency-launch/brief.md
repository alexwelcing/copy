# Creative Brief: Copy Agency Self-Marketing Campaign

## Project Overview

**Product**: Copy & Marketing Agency - An AI-powered marketing asset generation system built on Claude Code

**Objective**: Dogfood the system by using every skill to improve the product itself, proving value through demonstration.

**Core Tension**: Most AI writing tools produce generic slop. We built something different - a system that respects craft, understands strategy, and delivers work that actually converts.

## Target Audience

### Primary: Developers and Technical Founders
- Building products, not marketing departments
- Need marketing assets but hate writing them
- Value efficiency but won't accept garbage
- Already using Claude Code

### Secondary: Marketing Teams at Startups
- Small teams wearing many hats
- Need to scale content production
- Want frameworks, not just outputs
- Appreciate craft and strategy

### Tertiary: Freelance Marketers
- Looking for force multipliers
- Want to deliver more, faster
- Need consistent quality
- Value systematic approaches

## Messaging Framework

### Core Value Proposition
**One sentence**: Marketing expertise encoded into executable skills - 23 specialized frameworks that turn Claude Code into a full-service agency.

**Expanded**: Stop asking Claude to "write copy." Start deploying specialized marketing skills that encode decades of conversion expertise into repeatable, improvable workflows.

### Key Messages

1. **Skills, not prompts**: These aren't prompt templates. They're complete frameworks - the same mental models top marketers use, made executable.

2. **Strategy before words**: Every skill starts with understanding - audience, intent, psychology. Copy comes last.

3. **Compound expertise**: Each skill connects to others. Run a CRO audit, feed it into copywriting, validate with A/B testing. The system builds on itself.

4. **Prove by doing**: We dogfooded this entire system on itself. The README you're reading was written by our copywriting skill, optimized by our CRO skill.

### Positioning Against Alternatives

| Alternative | Their Approach | Our Approach |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| ChatGPT/Claude raw | Generic responses | Specialized frameworks |
| Jasper/Copy.ai | Template fill-in | Strategic thinking first |
| Human agencies | Expensive, slow | Fast, scalable, learnable |
| Prompt libraries | Copy-paste | Integrated workflows |

## Deliverables

### Immediate (This Campaign)
1. Rewritten README as high-converting landing page
2. Sharpened skill descriptions with psychological triggers
3. Launch strategy document
4. Competitive positioning guide
5. Onboarding email sequence
6. Social proof via demonstrated quality

### Artifacts
- All improvements committed to repo
- Before/after comparisons
- Metrics framework for measuring success

## Success Criteria

1. **Clarity**: Someone can understand what this is in 10 seconds
2. **Credibility**: Quality of writing proves the tool works
3. **Action**: Clear next step for every reader segment
4. **Memorability**: Distinct voice that stands out from AI slop

## Constraints

- No empty superlatives ("amazing", "powerful", "revolutionary")
- No AI-detection-triggering patterns
- No claims we can't demonstrate
- Must feel human-crafted, because it is human-directed

## Brand Voice

**We are**: Sharp. Direct. Craft-focused. Strategy-minded. Results-oriented.

**We are not**: Breathless. Hype-driven. Generic. Verbose. Hedging.

**Tone examples**:
- Good: "23 skills. Each one a complete framework."
- Bad: "An amazing collection of powerful AI-driven capabilities"
- Good: "Stop prompting. Start deploying."
- Bad: "Leverage our innovative solutions to unlock potential"
