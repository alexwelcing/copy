## Audience Insights

### Decision-Making Research

Based on Feit Consumer Insights research on legal news preferences:

| Attribute | Law360 Win Rate | ALM Win Rate | Gap |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-----|
| Accuracy | 52% | 17% | -35 |
| Relevance | 48% | 15% | -33 |
| Coverage Breadth | 51% | 18% | -33 |
| State/Jurisdictional | 49% | 14% | -35 |

- "I need industry-specific intelligence, not general legal news"
- "How do I justify this subscription to finance?"
- "I want benchmarking data, not just news"

#### Legal Operations
- "I need the data, not the articles"
- "Competitive intelligence on lateral moves is critical"
- "Am Law rankings drive my planning"

## Strategic Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: Data-First Positioning

**Insight:** Legal Compass and rankings data are unique assets that competitors cannot replicate.

**Recommendation:** Reposition Law.com not as a news destination but as "Legal Intelligence Platform" where news is one component of a data-driven ecosystem.

**Message Shift:**
- FROM: "Read the latest legal news"
- TO: "Make smarter decisions with legal intelligence"

---

### Opportunity 2: Vertical Depth vs. Horizontal Breadth

**Insight:** Law360 wins on breadth (60 practice areas). ALM cannot out-breadth them.

**Recommendation:** Win on depth in specific verticals where ALM publications have historic authority:
- M&A and transactional (The American Lawyer)
- NYC legal market (New York Law Journal)
- In-house practice (Corporate Counsel)

**Message Shift:**
- FROM: "Comprehensive legal news coverage"
- TO: "The definitive source for [specific vertical]"

---

### Opportunity 3: Exclusive Access Narrative

**Insight:** Content removal from Lexis/Bloomberg creates short-term pain but also exclusivity opportunity.

**Recommendation:** Position exclusivity as a feature, not a limitation. Frame direct relationship as premium.

**Message Shift:**
- FROM: "Now available on Law.com"
- TO: "Available nowhere else. Direct from the source."

---

### Opportunity 4: Community and Career

**Insight:** Above The Law wins engagement through community and career content. ALM has rankings/data but weak community.

**Recommendation:** Build community features around rankings—firms can claim profiles, lawyers can track careers, recruiters can access data.

**Message Shift:**
- FROM: "Read about industry trends"
- TO: "Track your career. Benchmark your firm. Join the conversation."

---
