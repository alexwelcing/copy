## Project Summary

### Client
**Law.com** (ALM Media) — Legal news and intelligence platform

### Challenge
Law.com faces a critical inflection point after removing content from third-party platforms (Lexis, Bloomberg) and must now win direct subscriber relationships against Law360, the dominant market leader.

### Key Finding
Law.com has exclusive, defensible assets (Am Law rankings, Legal Compass data) that should be the core value proposition—but are currently treated as features of a "news platform."

### Strategic Recommendation
**Reposition from "Legal News Platform" to "Legal Intelligence Platform"**

Lead with exclusive data and rankings rather than competing on news breadth where Law360 dominates.

### Projected Impact
- +40-60% conversion improvement
- +35-50% organic traffic growth
- +$1.3M-2.1M annual revenue
