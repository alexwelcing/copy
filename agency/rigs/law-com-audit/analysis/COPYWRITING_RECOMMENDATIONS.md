# Copywriting & Messaging Audit: Law.com

## Agent: Copywriter
## Skills Applied: `copywriting`, `marketing-psychology`
## Date: January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Law.com's current messaging relies heavily on category descriptors ("legal news," "publications") rather than outcome-driven value propositions. The messaging fails to differentiate from competitors or tap into the psychological drivers of the target audience. This audit provides a complete messaging framework with specific copy recommendations for all key touchpoints.

## Current Messaging Audit

### Homepage Headline Analysis

**Current (Observed Positioning):**
> "The Premier Source for Global Legal News"

**Issues:**
1. **Generic claim:** "Premier" is unsubstantiated and used by everyone
2. **Category description:** Tells what it is, not what it does for you
3. **No differentiation:** Could describe any legal news site
4. **Missing outcome:** What does the reader gain?

**Competitive Headlines:**
- Law360: "Legal News & Analysis"
- Bloomberg Law: "Legal Intelligence"
- Above The Law: "A Legal Web Site For Lawyers"

**Assessment:** The market is stuck in descriptive positioning. Opportunity exists to break out with outcome-driven messaging.

---

### Value Proposition Gaps

**What Law.com Says:** We publish legal news and host prestigious publications.

**What Users Need to Hear:**
- "I'll know what's happening before my competitors"
- "I'll make better business decisions"
- "I'll look informed to clients and partners"
- "I'll save time getting up to speed"
- "I'll benchmark my firm against the market"

**Gap:** The messaging focuses on the product, not the transformation.
