# Case Study: Law.com Full Marketing Audit

## High Era Agency Demonstration Project

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Challenge

Law.com, the flagship digital property of ALM Media, faces a critical inflection point. After removing content from third-party platforms (Lexis, Bloomberg) in January 2026 and merging with Law Business Research, the company must now win direct subscriber relationships in a market dominated by Law360, which is preferred 3x more than any competitor.

## Our Approach

High Era deployed a six-agent team to conduct a comprehensive marketing audit:

| Agent | Focus Area | Key Deliverable |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Director** | Project orchestration | This case study |
| **Strategist** | Market positioning | Competitive analysis |
| **Analyst** | SEO & metrics | Technical audit |
| **Optimizer** | Conversion funnel | CRO playbook |
| **Copywriter** | Messaging | Copy recommendations |
| **Editor** | Quality assurance | Final review |

## Key Findings

### 1. Positioning Problem
Law.com occupies dangerous middle ground: premium pricing without premium differentiation. The "Premier Source for Global Legal News" positioning is generic and vulnerable.

### 2. Conversion Friction
The subscription funnel loses an estimated 75% of potential subscribers through paywall confusion, registration friction, and weak trial experiences.

### 3. SEO Underperformance
Despite strong domain authority (78), Law.com underperforms on organic traffic relative to competitors, with technical issues limiting visibility.

### 4. Messaging Gaps
Current copy is feature-focused rather than outcome-driven, missing psychological triggers that drive legal professional purchasing decisions.

### 5. Unique Asset Underleveraged
Am Law rankings and Legal Compass data are exclusive, defensible assets that competitors cannot replicate—yet they're treated as features, not the core value proposition.

## Recommended Strategy

**Reposition from "Legal News Platform" to "Legal Intelligence Platform"**

- Lead with exclusive data and rankings
- Build intelligence-first messaging
- Reduce conversion friction
- Create community features around benchmarking

## Projected Impact

| Initiative | Investment | ROI Timeline | Impact |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Messaging Overhaul | Low | 2-3 months | +15-25% conversion |
| CRO Improvements | Medium | 3-6 months | +40-60% conversion |
| SEO Technical Fixes | Medium | 4-8 months | +35-50% organic traffic |
| Repositioning Campaign | High | 6-12 months | Market share defense |

**Total Revenue Opportunity:** $1.3M-2.1M annually from conversion optimization alone.

# DETAILED FINDINGS

## 1. Market Intelligence

### Competitive Landscape

The legal news market is consolidating around a few major players:

**Market Leaders:**
- **Law360** (LexisNexis): Dominant position, 3x preference over nearest competitor
- **Bloomberg Law News**: Premium integration, strong brand
- **Above The Law**: High engagement, younger demographic
- **JD Supra**: Free access, content marketing model

**Law.com's Position:**
- 4th-5th in most preference metrics
- 35-point gap behind Law360 across key attributes
- Perceived as legacy/traditional vs. digital-native competitors

### Strategic Opportunity

**Law.com's Defensible Assets:**
1. Am Law 100/200 rankings (45-year legacy, industry standard)
2. NLJ 500 data
3. Legal Compass benchmarking platform
4. Historic publication brands (American Lawyer, NYLJ)

**Recommended Positioning:**
"The intelligence platform behind legal industry benchmarking"

This positions Law.com where it can win—on exclusive data and rankings—rather than competing on news breadth where Law360 dominates.

## 2. SEO Audit

### Technical Issues Identified

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Fix Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Duplicate content across publications | Critical | High | High |
| Paywall schema markup inconsistent | Critical | Medium | Low |
| Core Web Vitals failing | High | High | High |
| URL structure inconsistency | High | Medium | Medium |
| Internal linking weakness | Medium | High | Medium |
| Missing structured data | Medium | Medium | Low |

### Keyword Gap Analysis

Law.com underperforms on high-value keywords despite domain authority:

- "biglaw news" — Rank 15 (Law360: #1)
- "legal industry trends" — Rank 22 (Law360: #3)
- "partner compensation" — Rank 12 (Law360: #2)
- "law firm mergers" — Rank 6 (Law360: #1)

**Exception:** Law.com leads on "am law 100" (Rank 2) where it has unique authority.

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Week 1-2):**
- Fix schema markup for paywalled content
- Implement canonical tags across publications
- Create and submit news sitemap

**Short-Term (Month 1):**
- Improve Core Web Vitals
- Create 5 topic hub pages
- Implement Related Articles module

**Medium-Term (Months 2-3):**

**Projected Impact:** +35-50% organic traffic over 6 months

## 3. Conversion Rate Optimization

### Funnel Analysis

```
Current Estimated Conversion Funnel:
─────────────────────────────────────
Visitors:          1,200,000
→ Paywall Hits:      400,000 (33%)
→ Registration:       12,000 (3% of paywall)
→ Trial Start:         8,000 (67% of registered)
→ Paid Subscriber:     1,600 (20% of trial)

Overall: 0.13% visitor-to-paid conversion
Industry Best: 0.25-0.40%
Gap: -50% to -67%
```

### Friction Points Identified

**1. Paywall Messaging:**
- Generic "You've reached your limit" messaging
- No value proposition at point of conversion
- Single CTA (no intermediate options)

**2. Registration Flow:**
- Too many form fields (estimated 8-12)
- No social sign-in (LinkedIn would be ideal)
- Email verification blocks access

**3. Trial Experience:**
- No structured onboarding sequence
- Generic welcome email only
- No usage-based conversion triggers

**4. Pricing Page:**
- Complex tier structure creates decision paralysis
- No price anchoring or ROI framing
- Missing social proof and guarantees

### Recommendations

**Quick Wins (This Week):**

## 4. Messaging & Copywriting

### Current State Assessment

**Homepage Headline:**
"The Premier Source for Global Legal News"

**Issues:**
- Generic claim ("Premier" = empty)
- Category description, not value proposition
- No differentiation from competitors
- Missing outcome for reader

### Audience Psychology Insights

**BigLaw Partners Want:**
- Competitive edge, status, efficiency
- **Trigger:** "What the Am Law 100 know that you don't"

**In-House Counsel Want:**
- ROI justification, career advancement, peer validation
- **Trigger:** "The intelligence that gets you promoted"

**Legal Operations Want:**
- Data exclusivity, strategic value, benchmarking
- **Trigger:** "Data available nowhere else"

### Recommended Messaging Framework

**Brand Positioning:**
"Legal Intelligence. Delivered."

**Messaging Pillars:**

| Pillar | Message | Proof |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Authority** | From the publications that define the profession | 45+ years, Am Law origin |
| **Exclusivity** | Content and data available nowhere else | Removed from Lexis/Bloomberg |
| **Intelligence** | Data + news = better decisions | Legal Compass integration |
| **Efficiency** | Know more in less time | Personalized alerts |

### Sample Copy Transformations

**Homepage Hero:**

*BEFORE:*
> "The Premier Source for Global Legal News"

*AFTER:*
> "The Legal Intelligence That Moves Markets—and Careers"
>
> The publications that define BigLaw. The rankings that benchmark the industry. The data that drives decisions. Now exclusively on Law.com.

## 5. Competitive Positioning

### Strategic Recommendation

**Stop competing on news breadth. Own intelligence and data.**

Law.com cannot out-breadth Law360 (60+ practice areas). But it can own the "legal industry intelligence" category with exclusive assets:

1. **Am Law 100/200** — The standard for firm benchmarking
2. **Legal Compass** — Proprietary database
3. **Publication Authority** — The American Lawyer, NYLJ heritage

### Competitive Messaging Matrix

| vs. Law360 | Key Message |
|------------|-------------|
| Objection | "Law360 covers more practice areas" |
| Counter | "We go deeper on what matters most: firm performance, career intelligence, and exclusive benchmarking data." |

| vs. Bloomberg | Key Message |
|---------------|-------------|
| Objection | "Bloomberg is in my workflow" |
| Counter | "Bloomberg is research with news. We're intelligence purpose-built for legal market decisions. Better value, deeper focus." |

| vs. ATL | Key Message |
|---------|-------------|
| Objection | "Above The Law is free" |
| Counter | "ATL is for watercooler. Law.com is for decisions. Read both, but benchmark with us." |

# CONCLUSION

Law.com has a defensible market position if it embraces what makes it unique: exclusive data, authoritative journalism, and benchmarking intelligence that competitors cannot replicate.

The path forward requires:

1. **Repositioning** from news platform to intelligence platform
2. **Reducing friction** in the subscription funnel
3. **Leading with data** in all marketing and messaging
4. **Building switching costs** through personalization and community

The opportunity is substantial. The risk of inaction is losing relevance as digital-native competitors continue to capture market share.

Law.com has the assets. Now it needs the execution.
