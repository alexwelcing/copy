# Law.com Marketing Audit
## Executive Summary

**Prepared by:** High Era Marketing Agency
**Date:** January 2026
**Classification:** Strategic Recommendations

---

## The Situation

Law.com, ALM's flagship digital property, faces an existential challenge. After removing content from Lexis and Bloomberg Law in January 2026, the company must now win direct subscriber relationships against Law360—a competitor preferred 3x more across virtually every measured attribute.

The current positioning ("The Premier Source for Global Legal News") is generic and indefensible. The subscription funnel is leaking conversions. And unique assets like Am Law rankings remain underleveraged.

**Bottom line:** Law.com has a 6-12 month window to reposition before its market position becomes unrecoverable.

## Key Findings

### 1. Positioning Crisis
Law.com occupies dangerous middle ground—premium pricing without premium differentiation. Every competitor has a clearer position:
- Law360 → Breadth and integration
- Bloomberg → Premium research platform
- Above The Law → Free and engaging
- Law.com → ???

### 2. Conversion Catastrophe
Current estimated conversion: **0.13%** visitor-to-subscriber
Industry benchmark: **0.25-0.40%**
**Gap: 50-67% below benchmark**

Primary friction points:
- Generic paywall messaging (no value proposition)
- Bloated registration (8-12 fields vs. 2-3 needed)
- No trial onboarding (single welcome email)
- Complex pricing (decision paralysis)

### 3. SEO Underperformance
Despite strong domain authority (78), Law.com ranks poorly on high-value keywords:
- "biglaw news" → Rank 15 (Law360: #1)
- "legal industry trends" → Rank 22 (Law360: #3)
- Losing ~2M+ monthly organic visits to competitors

### 4. Messaging Disconnect
Current messaging tells users what Law.com *is* ("legal news platform") rather than what it *does for them* ("makes you better at your job"). Zero psychological triggers. Zero differentiation.

## The Opportunity

**Law.com owns assets competitors cannot replicate:**

| Asset | Value | Defensibility |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Am Law 100/200 | Industry standard for 45 years | Exclusive |
| Legal Compass | Benchmarking database | Proprietary |
| Publication Brands | Am Law, NYLJ heritage | 100+ year legacy |

**These assets should be the product, not features of a news product.**

---

## Strategic Recommendation

### Reposition from "News" to "Intelligence"

**FROM:** "The Premier Source for Global Legal News"

**TO:** "The Legal Intelligence That Moves Markets—and Careers"

**Why this works:**
- Differentiates from news-focused Law360
- Leads with exclusive data advantage
- Appeals to decision-makers, not just readers
- Creates premium positioning that justifies premium pricing
