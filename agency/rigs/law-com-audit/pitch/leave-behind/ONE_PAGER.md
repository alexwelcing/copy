# Law.com Strategic Transformation

## One-Page Executive Summary

---

## THE CHALLENGE

Law.com faces a critical inflection point. After removing content from Lexis and Bloomberg Law, the company must win direct subscriber relationships against Law360—a competitor preferred **3x more** across virtually every measured attribute.

Current conversion rate: **0.13%** (benchmark: 0.30%)
Estimated annual revenue leak: **$2M+**

---

## THE INSIGHT

**Law.com owns assets competitors cannot replicate:**

| Asset | Authority | Exclusivity |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Am Law 100/200 | 45 years | Industry standard |
| Legal Compass | Proprietary | 95% of Am Law 100 |
| Publication Brands | 100+ years | Unmatched heritage |

**These assets should be the product—not features of a news product.**

## THE STRATEGY

### Reposition: News → Intelligence

| FROM | TO |
|------|-----|
| "Premier Source for Legal News" | "Legal Intelligence That Moves Markets" |
| Read articles | Make decisions |
| Access publications | Benchmark your firm |

### Convert: Fix the Funnel

- **Week 1:** Paywall messaging, social proof, guarantee
- **Month 1:** Registration simplification, onboarding sequence
- **Quarter 1:** Pricing rebuild, A/B testing program

### Defend: Build the Moat

- Community features around rankings
- Firm profile claiming
- Data network effects
