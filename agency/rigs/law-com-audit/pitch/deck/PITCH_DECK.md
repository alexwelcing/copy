# SPEAKER NOTES

## Slide 1 (Cover)
Open with confidence. This isn't a pitch—it's a strategic imperative. Pause before moving to slide 2.

## Slide 2 (The Moment)
Emphasize urgency without panic. "January 2026 wasn't a problem—it was a forcing function. Now you have the opportunity to own your future."

## Slide 3 (The Problem)
Let the numbers speak. Don't apologize for them. "This is the reality. The question is what we do about it."

## Slide 4 (The Gap)
This is the money slide. Point to specific friction points. "Every person who bounces at registration is a potential $500/year subscriber you're losing."

## Slide 5 (The Insight)
This is the turn. "But here's what they don't have—and can't get." Build excitement around the exclusive assets.

## Slide 6 (The Opportunity)
Make the positioning tangible. "This isn't wordsmithing. This is the difference between being a commodity and owning a category."

## Slide 7-10 (Strategy)
Walk through methodically. Each pillar should feel inevitable, not innovative. "Of course you reposition. Of course you fix conversion. Of course you defend."

## Slide 11 (Transformation)
Paint the picture. "In 12 months, this is your experience. This is what subscribers see."

## Slide 12-13 (SEO/Conversion)
Get tactical. Executives like specificity. "These aren't guesses. This is what the data tells us."

## Slide 14 (Competitive)
Give them the words. "When your sales team hears 'but Law360...' here's exactly what they say."

## Slide 15 (Roadmap)
Show you've thought through execution. "We're not asking for a year. We're asking for 90 days to prove this works."

## Slide 16-17 (Investment/ROI)
Be direct about money. "This is the investment. This is the return. The math works."

## Slide 18 (Risk)
Don't dwell, but be clear. "The cost of inaction is real. Every month of delay is revenue lost."

## Slide 19 (Why Us)
Brief. Confident. "We built this for exactly this situation."

## Slide 20 (Next Steps)
End with action. "Here's what happens next. I need three decisions from you today."
