## The Brief
**Task:** Develop a tiered pricing strategy for 'High Era', a premium automated marketing agency.
**Context:** {
  "brand": "High Era",
  "model": "Credits",
  "audience": "Mid-market B2B"
}

---

## The Output
# Pricing Strategy: High Era Premium Automated Marketing Agency

## Executive Summary

High Era is positioned as a premium automated marketing agency serving mid-market B2B companies. The recommended approach combines **tiered credit-based pricing** with **outcome-oriented packaging** to balance flexibility with predictable revenue while reinforcing premium positioning.

---

## 1. Recommended Pricing Model & Rationale

### Primary Model: **Tiered Credits with Monthly Subscriptions**

**Why this works for High Era:**

- **Credits align with agency value perception**: Marketing deliverables vary (blog post vs. full campaign), making credits intuitive
- **Predictable MRR with flexible consumption**: Monthly subscriptions provide revenue stability while credits offer usage flexibility
- **Premium positioning**: Credit packages feel more sophisticated than simple per-service pricing
- **Expansion revenue built-in**: Easy to upsell credits or tier upgrades as needs grow
- **Mid-market sweet spot**: B2B buyers appreciate predictability but need flexibility for seasonal campaigns

### Value Metric: **Marketing Credits**

**1 Credit = 1 "Marketing Unit"**
- Simple blog post (500-700 words): 2 credits
- Premium long-form content (2000+ words): 8 credits
- Social media package (week of posts): 5 credits
- Email campaign (design + copy): 6 credits
- Landing page (design + copy): 12 credits
- Full campaign strategy: 25 credits

**Rationale**: Credits abstract individual service costs while allowing customers to allocate resources across different marketing needs month-to-month.
