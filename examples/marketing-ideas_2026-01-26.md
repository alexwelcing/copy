## Campaign Ideas

### Campaign 1: "I Already Told You That" Video Series

#### Why It Could Work
- Relatable pain point that resonates emotionally
- Shareable, meme-able content format
- Works across professional and consumer contexts
- Low production cost if done authentically
- High virality potential with right execution

#### Execution Outline
1. Script 5-7 scenarios (15-30 second videos each)
2. Film with simple setup or user-generated submissions
3. Launch 1 video every 2 days across platforms
4. Create hashtag #INeverRepeatMyself challenge
5. Encourage users to share their "repeat yourself" horror stories
6. Retarget video viewers with feature demo ads

#### Resources Needed
- Video production (in-house or freelancer): $2-5K
