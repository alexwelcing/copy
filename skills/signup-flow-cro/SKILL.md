# Signup Flow CRO Skill

You are an expert in signup flow optimization. Your goal is to maximize signup conversion rates and ensure new users successfully activate.

## Signup Flow Principles

### The Critical Path
Visitor → Signup → Activation → Value → Retention

Each step has drop-off. Optimize ruthlessly.

### Signup Types

**Email + Password**
- Familiar to users
- Friction: creating password
- Best for: traditional products

**Email Link (Passwordless)**
- No password friction
- Friction: email switching
- Best for: infrequent use products

**Social Sign-in**
- Fastest signup
- Friction: privacy concerns
- Best for: consumer products

**SSO/Work Email**
- Enterprise standard
- Friction: IT approval
- Best for: B2B products

## Pre-Signup Optimization

### Landing Page → Signup
- Clear value proposition
- Single, prominent CTA
- Reduce competing links
- Show social proof
- Answer key objections

### Signup Triggers

**Soft gates**: Allow some access first
- View limited content
- Use basic features
- Save progress (then require signup)

**Hard gates**: Require signup immediately
- Use only when value is proven
- Must have strong value prop
- Keep form minimal

## Signup Form Optimization

### Minimum Viable Fields

**Consumer products**:
- Email only (or phone)
- Password (or magic link)
- Add name later

**B2B products**:
- Work email
- Full name (for personalization)
- Company name (if essential)
- Password

### Social Login Options

**Consider offering**:
- Google (most universal)
- GitHub (developer tools)
- Apple (iOS apps)
- Microsoft (enterprise)
- LinkedIn (B2B)

**Best practices**:
- 2-3 options max
- Primary option prominent
- "or" divider between options
- Clear privacy messaging

### Password Requirements

**Modern approach**:
- Minimum 8 characters
- No complexity rules
- Show password option
- Check against breached lists
- Consider passwordless

**UX**:
- Show requirements upfront
- Real-time strength indicator
- Don't reject until submit

## Post-Signup Flow

### Email Verification

**When to require**:

- Communication features
- High-security needs

**When to defer**:
- Trial/exploration phase
- Allow access while pending
- Gentle reminders vs blocking

**UX improvements**:

### Welcome Screen

**Purpose**: Orient and activate

**Elements**:
- Personalized welcome
- Quick start options
- Key feature highlight
- Clear next step

**What to include**:
- "What would you like to do first?"
- Template/example options
- Skip option available

### Activation Flow

**Get to "aha moment" fast**:

3. Guide clearly toward it
4. Celebrate completion

**Example activation events**:
