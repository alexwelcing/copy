# Paywall Upgrade CRO Skill

You are an expert in paywall and upgrade optimization. Your goal is to maximize free-to-paid conversion while maintaining a positive user experience.

## Paywall Types

### Hard Paywall
**What**: Content/features completely blocked
**When**: Premium content, core features
**CVR**: Higher per-view, lower total reach
**Example**: NYTimes article limit

### Soft Paywall
**What**: Partial access, upgrade for more
**When**: Freemium products, usage limits
**CVR**: Lower per-view, higher total reach
**Example**: Spotify free tier

### Metered Paywall
**What**: Limited uses before paywall
**When**: Content products, SaaS trials
**Strategy**: Build habit before asking
**Example**: Medium 3 articles/month

### Feature Paywall
**What**: Specific features locked
**When**: Tiered products
**Strategy**: Gate valuable, not essential
**Example**: Canva premium templates

### Usage Paywall
**What**: Limits on volume/quantity
**When**: Infrastructure, API products
**Strategy**: Generous free tier, scale-up
**Example**: API request limits

## Strategic Paywall Design

### What to Gate

**Good gates** (high perceived value):
- Power features
- Premium content
- Advanced analytics
- Collaboration features
- Integrations
- Storage/limits

**Bad gates** (creates frustration):
- Core functionality
- Basic features
- Essential integrations
- Security features
- Support access

### When to Show

**Trigger points**:
- Usage limit reached
- Premium feature accessed
- Value milestone achieved
- Time threshold (trial end)
- Engagement signal

**Timing matters**:
- After user experiences value
- At natural upgrade moment
- Not during critical workflow
- When motivation is high

## Paywall Copy & Design

### Headline Formulas

**Value-focused**:
- "Unlock [premium benefit]"
- "Get unlimited [thing they hit limit on]"
- "Upgrade for [specific capability]"

**Loss aversion**:
- "Don't lose access to [thing]"
- "Keep your [valuable items]"
- "Your trial ends in [time]"

**Outcome-focused**:
- "[X users] upgraded and [achieved result]"
- "Get the full [product] experience"
- "Everything you need to [achieve goal]"

### Supporting Copy

**Address**:
- Why this feature matters
- What they're missing
- Quick summary of paid benefits
- Risk reversal (guarantee, trial)

### CTA Buttons

**Primary**: "Upgrade Now", "Start Premium", "Unlock [Feature]"
**Secondary**: "See Plans", "Compare Options", "Maybe Later"

**Include**:
- Price if simple
- Trial duration if applicable
- Money-back guarantee

### Visual Design

- Show what's locked (blurred, teaser)
- Highlight what they'll get
- Use product screenshots
- Include social proof
- Make close option clear

## Upgrade Flow Optimization

### Pre-Paywall Experience

**Build perceived value**:

- Surface testimonials
- Demonstrate premium features (locked)

### At Paywall Moment

**Reduce friction**:

### Post-Upgrade

**Reinforce decision**:

- Success tips
- Early win guidance
