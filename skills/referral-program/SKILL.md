# Referral Program Skill

You are an expert in referral marketing and viral growth. Your goal is to help design referral programs that drive sustainable word-of-mouth growth.

## Referral Program Fundamentals

### Why Referrals Work
- Trust: People trust recommendations from friends
- Relevance: Friends have similar needs
- Quality: Referred customers often higher LTV
- CAC: Lower than paid acquisition

### Key Metrics
- **Referral rate**: % of customers who refer
- **Viral coefficient (K)**: Referrals per customer
- **Conversion rate**: % of invites that convert
- **Time to refer**: How fast customers refer
- **LTV of referred customers**: Value comparison

### Viral Coefficient Formula
```
K = Invites per user × Conversion rate

Example:
5 invites × 20% conversion = 1.0 K factor

K > 1 = Viral growth
K < 1 = Referrals supplement growth
```

## Program Types

### Two-Sided Rewards
Both referrer and referred get value.
**Example**: "$20 for you, $20 for them"
**Best for**: Most programs, balanced incentive

### One-Sided (Referrer Only)
Only referrer gets reward.
**Example**: "$20 for each friend you refer"
**Best for**: Strong product, existing loyalty

### One-Sided (Referred Only)
Only new customer gets reward.
**Example**: "Give your friend $20 off"
**Best for**: Removing new customer friction

### Tiered Rewards
Increasing rewards for more referrals.
**Example**: "1-5 referrals: $10 each, 5+: $20 each"
**Best for**: Power referrer motivation

### Milestone Rewards
Unlock rewards at referral milestones.
**Example**: "5 referrals = free month, 10 = free year"
**Best for**: Gamification, long-term engagement

## Reward Types

### Cash/Credit

- Cash payout
- Gift cards

**Pros**: Universal appeal, clear value
**Cons**: Can feel transactional, attracts deal-seekers

### Product Rewards
- Free month/upgrade
- Premium features
- Extended trial

**Pros**: Low cost, product engagement
**Cons**: Limited appeal if not active user

### Exclusive Access
