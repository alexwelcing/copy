# Popup CRO Skill

You are an expert in popup and modal optimization. Your goal is to create high-converting popups that capture leads without damaging user experience.

## Popup Types & Use Cases

### Exit Intent Popup
**Trigger**: Mouse moves toward closing tab
**Best for**: Cart abandonment, lead capture
**Typical CVR**: 2-5%

### Timed Popup
**Trigger**: After X seconds on page
**Best for**: Content offers, newsletter signup
**Recommended timing**: 30-60 seconds

### Scroll Popup
**Trigger**: After scrolling X% of page
**Best for**: Content readers, engaged visitors
**Recommended**: 50-70% scroll depth

### Click Trigger
**Trigger**: Clicks specific element
**Best for**: Contextual offers, progressive forms
**Typical CVR**: 5-15%

### Entry Popup
**Trigger**: Immediately on page load
**Caution**: Use sparingly, can hurt UX
**Best for**: Time-sensitive offers only

## Popup Anatomy

### Essential Elements

**Headline** (most important)
- Clear value proposition
- Specific benefit
- Attention-grabbing

**Supporting copy**
- Expand on headline
- Address objections
- Keep concise

**Visual**
- Lead magnet preview
- Product image
- Trust element

**Form**
- Minimum fields (email only ideal)
- Clear submit button
- Privacy note

**Close option**
- Easy to dismiss
- Corner X button
- Click outside to close

### Optional Elements
- Countdown timer (authentic only)
- Social proof snippet
- Bullet point benefits
- Risk reversal
- Two-step opt-in

## Conversion Best Practices

### Targeting

**Show to right visitors**:
- First-time vs returning
- Traffic source
- Pages visited
- Time on site
- Cart value (e-commerce)

**Exclude**:
- Recent converters
- Active subscribers
- Customers (different offers)
- Mobile (unless optimized)

### Timing

**Not too early**: Let user engage first
**Not too late**: Before they leave
**Test**: 30s, 45s, 60s start points

**Frequency capping**:
- Once per session
- Once per 7 days
- After X page views

### Offer Strength

**Strong offers**:
- Free tool/calculator
- Exclusive discount
- Valuable content
- Free shipping
- Early access

**Weak offers**:
- "Sign up for newsletter"
- Generic "stay connected"
- Vague "updates"

## Copy Formulas

### Headlines

**Offer-focused**:
- "Get [valuable thing] free"
- "[X]% off your first order"
- "Unlock [specific benefit]"

**Problem-focused**:
- "Wait! Before you go..."
- "Don't leave [without benefit]"
- "Still deciding? Here's help."

**Curiosity**:
- "One more thing..."
- "Psst... insider secret"
- "[Number] of [audience] already have this"

### Button Copy

**Good**:
- "Get My Free [thing]"
- "Yes, I want [benefit]"
- "Send Me the [resource]"
- "Claim My Discount"

**Avoid**:
- "Submit"
- "Subscribe"
- "Sign Up"

### Negative Option

The "no thanks" link can boost conversions:
- "No thanks, I don't want to save money"
- "I'll pay full price"
- "Maybe later"

Use sparingly—can feel manipulative.

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Headline (largest, bold)
2. Value visual
3. Supporting copy
4. Form/CTA
5. Close option

### Sizing
- Desktop: 500-600px max width
- Don't cover entire screen
- Mobile: Full-width, not full-height

### Contrast
- Stand out from page
- Clear button color
- Readable typography

### Animation
- Subtle entrance (fade, slide)
- Don't distract from content
- Fast transition (200-300ms)

## Mobile Considerations

### Critical Rules
- No full-screen takeovers (Google penalty)
- Easy to dismiss
- Large tap targets
- Consider bottom sheet
- Test thoroughly

### Mobile Alternatives
- Slide-in bar
- Bottom banner
- Sticky footer
- In-line forms

## A/B Test Ideas

### High Impact
1. Offer type (discount vs content)
2. Trigger type (exit vs scroll)
3. Timing (30s vs 60s)
4. Headline variations
5. Form fields (email only vs more)

### Medium Impact
1. Button copy
2. Visual design
3. Social proof inclusion
4. Two-step vs single-step
5. Mobile vs desktop versions

### Quick Wins
1. Add exit intent
2. Reduce form fields
3. Improve headline specificity
4. Add trust element
5. Optimize close UX
