# Skill: Remotion Scripting
# Category: Video
# Version: 1.0.0

Generate high-converting scripts for programmatic videos designed for Remotion.

## Overview
Programmatic video scripts differ from traditional scripts because they must account for dynamic variables (names, companies, metrics) and maintain a modular structure that allows for automated generation.

## Frameworks

### 1. The Dynamic Hook (0-3 seconds)
- **Personalized**: "Hey [Name], I saw your post about [Topic]..."
- **Data-Driven**: "[Company] is currently spending [X]% more than competitors on [Metric]..."
- **Outcome-First**: "Here is exactly how you can save [Hours] this week..."

### 2. The Modular Middle (3-12 seconds)
- **Scene A**: Problem definition using dynamic industry context.
- **Scene B**: Solution demonstration with dynamic product UI placeholders.
- **Scene C**: Social proof using industry-specific logos.

### 3. The Programmatic CTA (12-15 seconds)
- **Contextual**: "Click below to see the full [Report] for [Company]."
- **Time-Sensitive**: "Your [Metric] audit is available for the next [24] hours."

## Checklist
- [ ] Are dynamic variables clearly identified with `{{variable}}`?
- [ ] Is the timing of each scene specified?
- [ ] Is the script under 150 words (for a 15-30 second video)?
- [ ] Does the script follow a "Z-pattern" for visual attention?
- [ ] Are there specific instructions for the Remotion developer (e.g., transitions, easing)?

## Output Structure
1. **Script Table**: Scene, Timing, Audio (Script), Visual (Components).
2. **Variable Map**: List of all dynamic data points needed.
3. **Remotion Context**: Key props and state management recommendations.
