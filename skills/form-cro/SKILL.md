# Form CRO Skill

You are an expert in form optimization. Your goal is to increase form conversion rates by reducing friction, building trust, and making completion effortless.

## Form Conversion Fundamentals

### The Friction Formula
**Conversion = Motivation - Friction**

To increase conversions:
1. Increase motivation (value proposition, urgency)
2. Decrease friction (fewer fields, better UX)

### Key Metrics
- **View-to-start rate**: % who begin the form
- **Start-to-complete rate**: % who finish after starting
- **Completion rate**: Overall conversions
- **Drop-off points**: Where people abandon
- **Time to complete**: How long it takes

## Field Optimization

### Remove Unnecessary Fields

**Question each field**: Does this NEED to be collected NOW?

**Always remove**:
- Fields you won't use
- Fields collectible later
- Fields causing hesitation
- Duplicate information

**Common cuts**:
- Company size (ask later)
- Phone number (unless needed)
- Job title (unless critical for routing)
- "How did you hear about us"

### Field Types

**Use the right input**:
- Email: type="email" with validation
- Phone: type="tel" with formatting
- Dates: date picker, not text field
- Options: dropdown for 5+, radio for 2-4
- Long text: textarea with guidance

### Field Labels

**Do**:
- Clear, concise labels above fields
- Placeholder text for examples
- Required indicator (* or "Required")

**Don't**:
- Label inside field only
- Vague labels ("Details")
- ALL CAPS labels

### Smart Defaults
- Pre-fill known information
- Select most common option
- Use browser autofill
- Remember returning users

## Form Layout

### Single Column
Always use single column for forms. Multi-column:
- Increases completion time
- Creates confusion
- Breaks natural flow

### Field Grouping
Group related fields:
- Personal info together
- Address fields together
- Payment details together
- Clear section dividers

### Progressive Disclosure
Show fields conditionally:
- "Do you have an account?" → Show login
- "Need billing address?" → Show address fields
- Reduce overwhelming first impression

### Multi-Step Forms

**When to use**:
- 5+ fields required
- Different types of info
- Complex processes

**Best practices**:
- Show progress indicator
- Commit easiest info first
- Save progress as user goes
- Allow back navigation
- Summary before submit

## Trust & Motivation

### Near Form
- Reinforce value proposition
- Add testimonial snippet
- Show security badges
- Display guarantee
- Link to privacy policy

### Friction Reducers
- "No credit card required"
- "Takes 30 seconds"
- "We won't share your email"
- "Cancel anytime"

### Social Proof
- User count ("Join 50,000+ marketers")
- Recent signups
- Customer logos
- Review scores

## Error Handling

### Validation
- Inline, real-time validation
- Validate on blur, not keystroke
- Clear error messages
- Don't clear form on error
- Highlight field with issue

### Error Messages

**Bad**: "Invalid input"
**Good**: "Please enter a valid email (e.g., name@company.com)"

**Rules**:
- Explain what's wrong
- Tell how to fix it
- Be specific and helpful
- Never blame the user

## CTA Optimization

### Button Copy

**Generic (avoid)**:
- Submit
- Continue
- Next

**Specific (prefer)**:
- "Get My Free Report"
- "Start Free Trial"
- "Create Account"
- "Send My Quote"

### Button Design
- High contrast color
- Large enough to click/tap
- Full width on mobile
- Loading state after click
- Disabled state when incomplete

## Mobile Optimization

### Essential**:
- Large tap targets (44px+)
- Appropriate keyboard (email, number, tel)
- No horizontal scroll
- Touch-friendly selectors
- Thumb-reachable submit button

### Consider**:
- Autofill optimization
- Voice input support
- Camera for documents
- Biometric authentication

## A/B Test Ideas

### High Impact Tests
1. Number of fields (remove one at a time)
2. Single vs multi-step
3. Button copy variations
4. Form position on page
5. Social proof near form

### Medium Impact Tests
1. Field order
2. Optional vs required
3. Inline vs popup form
4. Error message style
5. Trust badge placement

### Quick Wins
1. Add placeholder examples
2. Improve error messages
3. Add progress indicator
4. Include friction reducer
5. Optimize for mobile
