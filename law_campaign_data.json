  "director_treatment": "DIRECTOR'S TREATMENT: 'Intelligence Over Urgency'\n\nVISUAL LANGUAGE:\nThis isn't a legal commercial. It's a precision instrument demonstration.\n\nWe're shooting in a dark, minimalist environment that feels like a high-security operations center. Think NORAD meets Apple keynote. The only light sources are from screens and interface elements.\n\nSCENE 01: COLD OPEN\nExtreme close-up on hands hovering over a keyboard. We see a complex legal query being typed at inhuman speed. Cut to screen: AI processing indicator, neural network visualization pulsing. The interface is clean, sophisticated - nothing like traditional legal research tools.\n\nSCENE 02: THE CONTRAST\nSplit screen technique. Left side: traditional legal research chaos - stacks of documents, overwhelmed attorney, clock showing 3AM. Right side: Law.com user - calm, focused, getting instant insights. The contrast is visceral.\n\nSCENE 03: THE INTELLIGENCE\nWe reveal the interface properly now. It's beautiful - precedent cases mapping in real-time, jurisdiction analysis, risk scoring. Everything moves with purpose. Graphics overlay showing: '47 cases analyzed in 2.3 seconds' - '94% accuracy rate' - 'Strategic recommendation: proceed with motion'.\n\nSCENE 04: THE DECISION\nGeneral Counsel in boardroom, confidently making a call. Quick cut to the Law.com interface on her tablet. She's not just informed - she's empowered.\n\nFINAL FRAME:\n'Law.com: Legal Intelligence Infrastructure'\n\nCOLOR PALETTE:\nDeep navy (#1a1f36) backgrounds, electric blue (#0066ff) accent, crisp white (#ffffff) text, subtle gold (#d4af37) for premium moments\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES:\n- Shoot on RED at 8K for extreme detail in UI elements\n- Heavy color grading for cinematic corporate aesthetic\n- Original score: subtle tension building to resolution\n- 30-second hero, 15-second social cuts\n- Ending cards optimized for LinkedIn and legal trade publications"
