    "solution_copy": "We craft workflow systems with the same precision you bring to tolerance specifications. Purpose-built tools that speak your language: elastomeric vs. pot bearings, settlement monitoring, phased replacements. Clean interfaces. Thoughtful details. The kind of considered design that lets you focus on the engineering that matters, not the software fighting against you.",
